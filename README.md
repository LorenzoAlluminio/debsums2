## Introduction

integrity checker is born as an extension of debsums2, which is in turn an extended version of the file integrity check tool 'debsums'. The major difference of debsums2 to debsums is the ability to verify the md5sums online. The online verification is based on the control file within the debian packages, debsums2 uses a partial download to minimize the required traffic. Verification by a third party at a remote location is possible as well. In case of heavy paranoia or when md5sums are missing for a file, full package download and file verification is possible.

Moreover integrity_checker aims at automating integrity checks for as many parts of a system as possible, not just for deb packages.

There are 2 ways in which you can use the tool:
- [without the hashdb](#usage-without-the-hashdb), by computing on the fly the hashes of files and comparing them online.
- [with the hashdb](#usage-with-the-hashdb), by crawling the entire system (or part of it) and storing checksums in a json file, that later can be used as ground truth in order to detect if a file has been modified.

Things that can be checked:
- deb packages (inherited from debsums2)
- python libraries (new feature)

Future improvements:
- git repositories
- Arch Linux packages (ALPs, file extension: .pkg.tar.xz)
- Gentoo packages (file extension: .tbz2)
- RPM packages (file extensions: .rpm, .src.rpm)
- integrating the new features with the hashdb

## Requirements

```bash
  pip3 install urllib3
  pip3 install simplejson
  apt-get install python3-apt
```

## Testing

If you want to test the project or check out the functionalities, I suggest that you do it using the Dockerfile that is provided in this repository. This enables you to have a small out of the box environment where you have everything that is needed to run the project and a complete system check can be performed in a reasonable amount of time.

- build the docker
```bash
docker build -t integrity_checker .
 ```

 - run the docker and mount the folder containing the script
 ```bash
 docker run --volume $PWD:/home/integrity_checker -it -d --name integrity_checker integrity_checker
 ```

 - access the docker and run command from there
 ```bash
 docker exec -it integrity_checker /bin/bash
```

## Usage without the hashdb

When the script terminates, you can check the integrity_checker.log to look for file with different trustlevels:
```bash
cat integrity_checker.log | grep trustlevel=4
cat integrity_checker.log | grep trustlevel=3
cat integrity_checker.log | grep trustlevel=2
cat integrity_checker.log | grep trustlevel=1
cat integrity_checker.log | grep trustlevel=0
```
This is useful for every command that you can launch.

### complete online system check

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --complete-system-check --online --ignore-pyc
```

This command will perform an online check of all the deb packages and all the python libraries.
Moreover the `--ignore-pyc` option will ensure that the .pyc file are ignored when verifying hashes of the python libraries.

### complete online deb packages check
```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --all-packages --online
```
This command will perform an online check of all the deb packages of the system.

### complete online python libraries check
```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --check-all-py --ignore-pyc
```
This command will perform an online check of all the python libraries.
Moreover the `--ignore-pyc` option will ensure that the .pyc file are ignored.

### selective online deb packages check
```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --package bash vim --online
```
This command will perform an online check of the files belonging to the packages bash and vim.
1 or more packages can be specified.

### selective online python libraries check
```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --check-py simplejson urllib3 --ignore-pyc
```
This command will perform an online check of the files belonging to the libraries simplejson and urllib3.
Moreover the `--ignore-pyc` option will ensure that the .pyc file are.

### changing the package managers

By default the script uses the command `pip2` and `pip3` to check for the python libraries. If you want to change this behavior you can supply your own list with the option --py-package-managers:

 ```bash
 python3 integrity_checker.py --check-all-py --py-package-managers pip
 ```

 ### Single file check, offline

 ```bash
  python3 integrity_checker.py --file /bin/bash
 ```

 ### Single file check, online

 ```bash
 python3 integrity_checker.py --online --file /bin/bash
 ```

 ### Package check, online

 ```bash
 python3 integrity_checker.py --online --package bash
 ```

 There are 66 files found within the package, 4 files do not have a checksum, otherwise clean. As for those 4 files: Debian decided not to generate md5sums for almost all of the configuration files below `/etc` in their packages.
 If you want to verify those files online, you will have to download the full packages (see next example). I suggest running this verification using `--directory=/etc --writedb` after checking and storing everything else.

 ### Package check, online with full package download

 ```bash
 python3 integrity_checker.py --online-full --package bash
 ```

 ### Directory check, online

 ```bash
 python3 integrity_checker.py --directory=/bin --online
 ```

 integrity_checker stays on the device where directory is located, it will not follow mount points.

## Usage with the hashdb

### complete system crawl

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --directory / --online --writedb
```

This will check your local system without the mount points. It is wise to delete all pyc files first (`find / -name \*.pyc -delete`).

The first run with `--writedb` will create a file `hashdb.json`, storing the md5sums and package information.
A md5sum is calculated for this file before and after the integrity_checker run, you may store that value somewhere offline.

After the run you will need to analyze the log (`integrity_checker.log`), look for `trustlevel=0` (changed file) and `trustlevel=1` (unknown file).

Example entry:
```bash
 {
  "filename": "/bin/bash",
  "md5_hl": "144968564a6b1159ed82059920cea76f",
  "md5_info": "144968564a6b1159ed82059920cea76f",
  "package": "bash",
  "uri": "http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/
  b/bash/bash_4.2+dfsg-0.1+deb7u3_amd64.deb"
 }
```

### Writing single directory to the hashdb

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --directory=/bin --writedb
```

### Writing single directory to the hashdb, adding online verification

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --directory=/bin --writedb --online
```

integrity_checker reads the stored information for this run, all files were checked before. The hashdb contains "md5_online" for each entry after the run, the checksum for `hashdb.json` is updated.

### Update the hashdb

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --update --online
```

First check `integrity_checker.log` for any irregularity. If you are sure you want the new status stored, run again and write to storage.

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --update --online --writedb
```

`--update` is to be run after `apt-get update`. It finds removed, added and changed files as well as changed uris.
This command only makes sense on a fully crawled system (`integrity_checker.py --directory=/`), since `--update` does not work on local files, but compares the dpkg cache to the hashdb.


### Verification of md5sums stored in hashdb

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py --verify-online
```

If the number of mismatched md5sums is not null, check `integrity_checker.log` for details.

This command is for everybody with a high paranoia level suspecting a deeply compromized system, therefore the command can and should be run on a different system, you will need to transfer the hashdb. Be aware that the download of all control files takes some time, you can watch the progress with `tail -f integrity_checker.log`.

## Result codes

The result of an integrity check is printed as a single character. Detailed information is logged into `integrity_checker.log`.

* verified online against debian package: dot (`.`) / `trustlevel=4`
* verified locally against debian package: star (`*`) / `trustlevel=3`
* verified locally against the hashdb, needs `--writedb` in a previous integrity_checker run: dash (`-`) / `trustlevel=2`
* not verified, probably new or changed file: plus (`+`) / `trustlevel=1`
* verification failed, see integrity_checker.log for info/warning: exclamation mark (`!`) / `trustlevel=0`
